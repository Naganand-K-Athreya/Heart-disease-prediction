# STEP 1: Install bun
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

**cd [FILE_NAME]**

**bun install**
This installs packages defined in package.json and bun.lockb.

# STEP 4: Run the Development Server
Try running the dev server (usually defined in package.json scripts):
**bun dev** 
If that doesn't work, check for other script options with:
**bun run**
Or look inside the package.json under "scripts" to see the available commands.

# STEP 5: Open the App
Once the server is running, you should see output like:
Server running at http://localhost:3000
Open that URL in your browser to view the app.
